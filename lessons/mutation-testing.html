# Mutation Testing in Action

---

# Code Coverage
Misleading metric

- Detects untested area
- Tells nothing about tested area

Percentage of your code executed by your tests

No behaviours


<div class="red-bg" style="text-align: center;">
  You can have 100% code coverage with no assertions
</div>

---
# 100% Coverage without assertions

1. Imagine you have a code with 100% coverage
2. Now imagine deleting all assertions
3. Run your code coverage tool again

<div class="red-bg" style="text-align: center;">
  The result? 100% coverage

# Mutation Testing

Modified versions of source code - mutants

Artifical bugs

Created both manually and by frameworks

# Code coverage vs Mutation Testing

Code Coverage: how much the bread is covered

Mutation Testing: what the bread covered with

# Example

```
public bool IsUserOldEnough(User user) {
  return user.Age >= 18;
}
```

---
# Example - Mutation # 1

```
public bool IsUserOldEnough(User user) {
  return user.Age > 18;
}
```

---

# Example - Mutation # 2

```
public bool IsUserOldEnough(User user) {
  return user.Age < 18;
}
```

---
# Example - Mutation # 3

```
public bool IsUserOldEnough(User user) {
  return true;
}
```

---

# Example - Mutation # 3

```
public bool IsUserOldEnough(User user) {
  return false;
}
```

# Type of Mutation

TODO: do example one by one

Operator Mutations
- e.g., replacing "+" with "-"

Conditional Mutations
- e.g., negating booleans

Statement mutation
- e.g., deleting a line of code

Value mutation
- e.g., altering a function's return value

# Mutation Score

Measuring the quality of the tests

For every mutant we run all our tests and check if they fail or not

<span class="green-bg"> Killed Mutant</span>: At least one failing test

<span class="red-bg"> Surviving Mutant</span>: No failing test

$$
\text{Mutation Score} = \frac{\text{Number of Killed Mutants}}{\text{Number of All Mutants}} \times 100
$$
