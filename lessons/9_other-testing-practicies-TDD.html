# Building .NET API with TDD

---
class: center, middle

---

Integration tests:

one per slice

integratio ntests are good if we can use them to drive the design. Lot of external calls, etc, dont allow e that

---

TDD is grat start, but you need more:

integraion testing

mutation testing

property-based testing

integration testing

load testing

penetration testing

exploratory testing

and most importantly, beta testing with our customers.

Postman API testing

Create Error classes
```
rewrite
public static class FollowerErrors
{
    public static readonly Error SameUser = new Error(
        "Followers.SameUser", "Can't follow yourself");

    public static readonly Error NonPublicProfile = new Error(
        "Followers.NonPublicProfile", "Can't follow non-public profiles");

    public static readonly Error AlreadyFollowing = new Error(
        "Followers.AlreadyFollowing", "Already following");
}
```
Instead of static fields, you can also use static methods returning an error.

```
public static class FollowerErrors
{
    public static Error NotFound(Guid id) => new Error(
        "Followers.NotFound", $"The follower with Id '{id}' was not found");
}
```
