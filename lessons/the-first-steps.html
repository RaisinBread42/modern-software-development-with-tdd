# Why we do TDD?

---
Problem #1 - Long feedback loop
  - Code as a text
  - Lag between changing the code and executing it
  - Long feedback loops
  - Source of many problems

---

Problem #2 - Risky changes
- Fear of refactoring
- Low confidence in test suite
- High chance of introducing bugs

---

Problem #3 - Extensive use of debugger
- Developers spend 25-50% of the time debugging 
- Extensive use of debugger (add image)
- Ironic and self-deprecating humor

Problem #4 - Bugs

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

---

Problem #4 - Bugs

- Bugs are expensive and oftentime disastrous
- Costs our reputation
- We cant fulfill our most important task

Problem # 5 - Famous last words: We will refactor it later

<img src="./assets/refactoring-later.png" alt="Example Image" style="width:500px;">

Problem # 5 - Refactoring later

- Never happens
- Hard justify - hard to sell
- There are always important stuff to do
- Lead to maintainable code (big ball of mud & spaghetti code)

# Why we do TDD?

---

TDD solves all the discussed problems

- Reduce feedbackloops - running our test all the time
- No risky changes as TDD leads to fully tested 
- Minimized debugging - we run test all the time
- Bugs are prevented - strong test suit and tested code
- Refactoring is done/reminded in every cycle of TDD
- Lead to maintainable code (big ball of mud & spaghetti code)

TODO: IN "iS DEISGN ,DEVELOPEMTN OR TESTIN" newsleter I have reasons  how the cycle fixes all. 

We should include it somewhere here as next



todo: write about the problems,
