#<span class="green-bg" style="text-align: center;">You can't have clean code without clean tests</span>

# Tests are first class-class citiezes

They:
- Prove if the code works
- Tell how the code works
- They ensure testable design
- They document business knowledge

# What is a TDD test?

## Only one requirement
- It must be fast
- Runs within 50ms, ideally 10ms

<div class="green-bg" style="text-align: center;">
  A TDD tests reads like a story, containing all the info needed to grasp the story.

## Which naming template to use?

# Meaningful namings

### Tips:
- Don‚Äôt pollute names with technical details
- Use functional namings relating to the business domain
- Use named constants for magic numbers/strings
- Don't use custom abbreviations
- Avoid noise and redundant words
- Be explicit instead of implicit
- Be consistent with concepts

# Clean assertions

Ensures working code

Capture domain knowledge

# The 5 most common test smells


---
# Smell #1 - Eager tests

‚ùå Problem

The test is hard to understand as it verifies too much functionality in a single test method.

üîÉ Cause

Having multiple Act and Assert parts within a test.

---
# Smell #1 - Eager tests

Multiple behaviors are covered

```cs
public void TestBankAccount()
{
    string validAccountNumber = "123456789";
    decimal initialBalance = 1000m;
    BankAccount account = new BankAccount(validAccountNumber, initialBalance);

    account.AccountNumber.Should().Be(validAccountNumber);
    account.Balance.Should().Be(initialBalance);
    account.IsActive.Should().BeTrue();

    account.Deposit(500m);
    account.Balance.Should().Be(1500m);

    decimal withdrawalAmount = 1600m;
    Action act = () => account.Withdraw(withdrawalAmount);
    act.Should().Throw<InvalidOperationException>();

    withdrawalAmount = 500m;
    account.Withdraw(withdrawalAmount);
    account.Balance.Should().Be(1000m);
}
```
---
# Smell #1 - Eager tests

‚úÖ Solution: Split up the test into multiple test cases

```cs
[Test]
public void ActiveAccountShouldBeInitialized_WhenConstructed(){...}

[Test]
public void ShouldIncreaseBalance_WhenDepositIsMade(){...}

[Test]
public void ShouldReturnError_WhenWithdrawAmountExceedsBalance(){...}

[Test]
public void ShouldDecreaseBalance_WhenValidWithdrawIsMade(){...}

```

---
# Smell #2 - Mistery Guest

‚ùå Problem

The reader must look outside the test to understand the behavior being verified.

üîÉ Cause

Some global context is used to initialize data for reusing objects and avoiding duplication.

---
# Smell #2 - Mistery Guest

We don‚Äôt have any info about the `User`:

```cs
[Test]
public void ContactShouldContainCombinedNameAndAddress()
{
    // Act
    var contact = user.GetContact();

    // Assert
    contact.Should().Be("John Smith, 123 Main St, Springfield, 12345");
}
  ```
---
# Smell #2 - Mistery Guest

‚úÖ Solution: Include all the data.

```cs
[Test]
public void ContactShouldContainCombinedNameAndAddress()
{
    var user = new User
    {
        FirstName = "John",
        LastName = "Smith",
        Address = new Address
        {
            Street = "123 Main St",
            City = "Springfield",
            ZipCode = "12345"
        }
    };

    var contact = user.GetContact();

    contact.Should().Be("John Smith, 123 Main St, Springfield, 12345");
}
```

---
# Smell #3 - Test with irrelevant data

‚ùå Problem

It's hard to tell which data affects the test result.

üîÉ Cause

There is too much irrelevant information in the test case.

---
# Smell #4 - Test with irrelevant data

Irrelevant data increases noise and decreases readability

```cs
[Test]
public void PaymentShouldFail_WhenEmployeeHasInvalidId()
{
    Employee employee = new Employee("1234A", "John", "Doe", new Address("934-111", "Hungary"));
    
    paymentService.DeliverPayTo(employee);
    
    AssertPaymentNotDeliveredTo(employee);
}
```
---

# Irrelevant data - Fix #1

Use dummy null values

```
[Test]
public void PaymentShouldFail_WhenEmployeeHasInvalidId()
{
    Employee employee = new Employee("1234A", null, null, null);
    
    paymentService.DeliverPayTo(employee);
    
    AssertPaymentNotDeliveredTo(employee);
}
```

---

# Irrelevant data - Fix #2

Extract to function

```
[Test]
public void PaymentShouldFail_WhenEmployeeHasInvalidId()
{
    Employee employee = CreateEmployeeWithId("1234A");
    
    paymentService.DeliverPayTo(employee);
    
    AssertPaymentNotDeliveredTo(employee);
}
```

---

# Irrelevant data - Fix #3

Use builder pattern

```
[Test]
public void PaymentShouldFail_WhenEmployeeHasInvalidId()
{
    Employee employee = new EmployeeBuilder()
                              .WithId("1234A")
                              .Build();
    
    paymentService.DeliverPayTo(employee);
    
    AssertPaymentNotDeliveredTo(employee);
}
```

---
# Smell #4 - Test with logic

‚ùå Problem

Tests are too complex to understand and prone to bugs.

üîÉ Cause

You use logic in tests such as if-else statements, loops, or switch cases.

---

# Smell #4 - Test with logic

```cs
[Test]
public void MembershipFeeShouldBeCalculated_withDifferentJoinDates()
{
    var members = new List<GymMember>
    {
        new GymMember("Jason Statham", new DateTime(2021, 8, 22)),
        new GymMember("Steven Seagal", new DateTime(2024, 3, 11))
    };

    foreach (var member in members)
    {
        if (member.JoinedBefore(new DateTime(2022, 1, 1)))
        {
            var fee = MembershipFeeCalculator.Calculate(member);
            Check.That(fee).IsEqualTo(new Fee(100, "EUR"));
        }
        else
        {
            var fee = MembershipFeeCalculator.Calculate(member);
            Check.That(fee).IsEqualTo(new Fee(150, "EUR"));
        }
    }
}


```

---

# Smell #4 - Test with logic

‚úÖ Solution: Avoid any logic in your test code!

```cs
[TestCase("Jason Statham", "2021-08-22", 100)]
[TestCase("Steven Seagal", "2024-03-11", 150)]
public void MembershipFeeShouldBeCalculatedCorrectly(
    string name,
    DateTime joinDate,
    decimal expectedFee)
{
    var member = new GymMember(name, joinDate);

    var fee = MembershipFeeCalculator.Calculate(member);

    Check.That(fee).IsEqualTo(new Fee(expectedFee, "EUR"));
}

```
???
Once you feel the need for these, it's a smell that you test more than one thing. You can get rid of test logic by splitting up your tests into multiple test cases.

Another option is to use parameterized tests to declare your test cases and to avoid duplication:

---

# Smell #5 - Slow tests

‚ùå Symptom

Your unit tests take minutes to run.

üîÉ Cause

You use real and time-consuming dependencies when you run your tests.

‚úÖ Solution

Mock your dependencies using one of the five test doubles.

---

# Use case in webshop

Given a shopping cart that has products with a total grand 50 

When the total grand is calculated 

Then it returns 50 as the total grand

---

# Bad Test

```cs
void ShoppingCartTest()
{
    var sc = new ShoppingCart();
    sc.Add(new Product("id1", 10, "product 1", Category.Book));
    sc.Add(new Product("id2", 15, "product 2", Category.Electronic));
    sc.Add(new Product("id3", 25, "product 3", Category.Hardware));
    var p = sc.Calc();
    Assert.True(p == 50);
}
```

---

# Clean Test

```cs
void CalculatePriceShouldSumPrices_whenCartContainsMultipleProducts()
{
    // Arrange
    var shoppingCart = new ShoppingCart();

    shoppingCart.Add(Product().WithPrice(10));
    shoppingCart.Add(Product().WithPrice(15));
    shoppingCart.Add(Product().WithPrice(25));

    // Act
    var totalPrice = shoppingCart.CalculateTotalPrice();

    // Assert
    Assert.That(totalPrice).IsEqualTo(50);
}

```
