# Clean Architectures

✅Pros:
- Independent of frameworks
- Independent of UI, DB and any external dependencies
- Testable

❌Cons:
- Too opinionated - too many rules
- Organized by technical concerns
- Changes involves many layers - slower development time
- High entry curve for new developers

???
- high entry curve for developers
    - to understand functionality, you need to have many files open and jump back and forth

Tells you how to write software without knowing the domain.

It gives us the freedom to use what we want

TDD STRATEGY

- SOLITARY VS SOCIABLE TEST
- LONDON
- CGHICAGO FOR state
    - IBERACTIS FOR EXTERNA L SERVUICE CALLS
- NO LOW level
-    EXCEPTIONS: domain entities, business heavy logic, property based testing
-REFACTOR ARCHITECTURE EASILY - NO FRAGILE  TESTS
---
Notes:

Layered Archi, Hexagonal Architecture, values
You can have use TDD on all, the problem with the first 2 that they are too opinionated 


Pragmatic Archiecture is a methdlogy/mindset, not an endstate

How much design do we need to implement right now to keep the codebase maintainable?

That is how we want to keep our solutions lean, simple and minimal. 

This is how we can shift away from thinking about endstates and required structures.

Get what is good, trhrow away what is right.

How about DDD? 

Get what is good: uniquitios language, model distillation, bounded context

add jimmys's image

Throw away what you dont need: Patterns are good, but not like 

Add post image: guidelines, not rigid rules

DDD is not about sturctural patterns, it is about collaborating closely with domain experts and have a clear understand about what we want to build, then do it in short, Iterative
Dont ask the csutoemr what features they want.

https://verticalslicearchitecture.com/

Disadvantages:

Talk about why Repository pattern is an anti paytern violating SRP

---jim
VSA:
move code to single place

InvoiceSerivce
- void approved
- void Reject
- void flag
todO: show image to move these into separate classes

Move these to separate, they are phusicall separated

Commans/Queries first class citizens

Modelling requests:
Input -> RequestHandler -> Output (chcek jim immage)

MediatR
IRequest -> IRequestHandle<TReq,TRes> -> TResponse

Image about coming a GET/Request, goes to WebApp layer then to query-handle-response or command-handler-response

Image about Complete Encapsulation

Areas of change only one folder, that's it

QUERIES:
Query->Response->Handler
Show code about Queriy types

SHow code about Response

Show example code of Handler, where we use ORM
Show example where we use raw SQL, so we optimize

Query -> ORM - Response
Query -> dapperrawSql -> Response
Query -> HttpClient - Response

You dont need, But you ahve the easy freedom.

But shared logic in common:
- class, function, extension method (check other part for this)


COMMANDS:

Show example of Command:
(like user type input)

Command is a model of an indivudual operation

Show an UI image with thre button then on the right show the 3 C-H-Resp image

modellingReponse: 
- success of fail
- guid
- or even complex result - check Jim code about complex response (introduce only if needed)


Query/Command duality

show code example:
check again


HANDLERS:
- procedural code
- simplest thing that possibly work - TDD style
- only adding abstaction if pain aries, not before

Handlers can become complex?
no worries, TDD refactor step, investigating code smells
- large class -> Extract class, extract subclass
long method -> extract method, move method
push logic to the domain obhject (so load, domkain does the job, save)


Drive refactoring based on code smells.

For example complex swith statement with Strategy Pattern pattern.

So start with the smell, then drive the design

VLAIDATION SCOPES:

request VLAIDATION:
- fluentValidation

Command vlidation (domain model, db, external mode)

CROSS CUTTING CONCERNS: pipeline behaviours!!!

QUESTION: wher we need UoW?
check the a architecture is slices slidesheet

Further notes:
Clean Architecture favours a layered approach, where each layer is a technical concern.
VSA favours a feature-based approach, where each feature is a business concern.

Show the direction of dependencies in images
Layers for both ca and VS
- pres
- app
- domain
- infra

a slice represents a self-contained unit of functonaltiy
contains all the logic to implement a feature
- also helps to wrap the feature under feature flag

Benefits:
- improved cohesion
- reduced complexity
- focus on business logic
- high coupling inside the slice, low coupling with other features
- more screaming Architecture - easier nagivation and maintenance  

3 things in an api
- presentation logic - json, xlm, conversiin
- business logic - business rules
- persystence logic

todo: add image - also for CS project 

VSA:
You only need a new project when you need a new assembly.

Everything else should be folder structures and namespaces.

If the deployment sturcutre requires, or multiple applications would use,  you can pull out things to separate assemblies.

Use the abstractions you need but not one more. You need an abstraction? Do it

Optimize on the fly, instead of being upfront and descriptive what to use.


TODO:
- every single slice needs an integration test?!
- or we mock out DB, and do contract testing.

Either:
- Integraion tests
- plus domain

Or:
- sociable test with mocked stuff
- integration test

integratio ntests are good if we can use them to drive the design. Lot of external calls, etc, dont allow e that


MIGRATING FROM CLEAN/N-TIER
- defactor if I dont understanding, indline indline
---check the nature
-entire team should agree upon, and should have ReadToEndAsync
-process with an intended completion, or experiment and roll it back
-architecutre should have consistency
-make sure the migration compltes, or roll back

AVOID SHARED DOMAIN?
- nah, it is fine

How about extracting DB logic such?

Dont create generic sutff like manager, repo expects

Make specifif objects like XQuery, or YApprover (instead of YService.Approve())

COpin:

VSA:
CA organizes code into layers
- why CA is good? Stability, everything depends on domain, so no UI changes etc should ha ve impa ct on it
- when you need a simple change, you need to change in a lot of places/projects
- physical layers (show 4 projects)
- in order to understand functionality, you need to have 10 different files to open and jump back and fort

Show CA an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Wnq0ChAIA
- find template projects and show the projects structure

Dont organize code by technical concerns? Because coupling

But how about cohesion? Low coupling nad high cohesion

cohesion: degree t owhich the elemnets inide a module belong together
- grouped related to operation on data
- grouped related to operations of a task



Coupling: degree of interpdenednenceb between software  modules
- show big ball of mud diagram


Logical boundaries:
feature | feature | feautre
MOOOOOODEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELELLLL
        (Database)

CQRS: 
- separation of concerns?
- eliminates the need of serivces having massive lines of codes. It streamslines the communication between developers and makes the code more intuitive.
- modelling actions in our system in terms of commands, which are things that mutate state, and queries that read state
- commands: mutate state
- add image for commands-queires
- does it solve coupling?
- you dont need, but it makes the separation clearer


TODO: refine this

SLices does not mean sharing isn't allowed. It's just it is not the default choice.

Whereas in layered approach, sharing means default choice. 

Defer sharing decision, not eliminate it.

Code sharing? 
- extension methods
- refactoring to functions/classes as logic
- domain model

Coupling here and there is not the end of the world.

Readable, testable, team-driven clean code is more important.

VSA summary:
- functional cohesion
- organize by feature
- decidesion by feature

we can still have coupling with VSA, but better cohesion.

TradeOffs vof VSA: (TODO: find more flaws)
- pragmatics over consistency
- requires constant evaluation

Testing .NET API
Why is it good?
Even if ou have clean architecutr,e dont change it because I said
 you can do the same, high level tests
 that's the beauty. I can easiy refactor this code using CleanArchitecture, and tests remain,
  only there will be some more dependencies for the text context

Solitary and socialble tests
Sometimes even real database, for smaller systems


---
# Coding example TODOS:

- show in the code that everyhing in one file would be in different layers
- warehousing, sales, catalog
