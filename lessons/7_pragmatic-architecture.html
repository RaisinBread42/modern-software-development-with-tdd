# The Pragmatic Architecture

Notes:

Layered Archi, Hexagonal Architecture, values
You can have use TDD on all, the problem with the first 2 that they are too opinionated 

They are too opinionated.
They are promised to be usefull for complex domains but the rules hurts

The goal of software design is to come up with a solution in the form of code
- easy to understand
- easy to Test
- east to change
- eay to maintainability

Pragmatic Archiecture is a methdlogy/mindset, not an endstate

How much design do we need to implement right now to keep the codebase maintainable?

That is how we want to keep our solutions lean, simple and minimal. 

This is how we can shift away from thinking about endstates and required structures.

Get what is good, trhrow away what is right.

How about DDD? 

Get what is good: uniquitios language, model distillation, bounded context

Throw away what you dont need: Patterns are good, but not like 

Add post image: guidelines, not rigid rules

DDD is not about sturctural patterns, it is about collaborating closely with domain experts and have a clear understand about what we want to build, then do it in short, Iterative
Dont ask the csutoemr what features they want.

Further notes:
Clean Architecture favours a layered approach, where each layer is a technical concern.
VSA favours a feature-based approach, where each feature is a business concern.

3 things in an api
- presentation logic - json, xlm, conversiin
- business logic - business rules
- persystence logic
